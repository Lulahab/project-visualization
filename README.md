# Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals
This project aims to analyze Airbnb pricing trends using Tableau, focusing on room types, neighborhoods, and property characteristics. The key goals were:

Explore average prices by room type, neighborhood, property, and zip code.
Understand the distribution of beds by neighborhood.

## Process

step 1

Data Cleaning in Python
I cleaned the dataset by detecting and removing price outliers using the quartile method.

step 2

Data Analysis in Tableau
I imported the cleaned data into Tableau and created the following visualizations:

Average Price per Room Type
Distribution of Beds by Neighborhood
Average Price by Neighborhood
Average Price by Property Type
Price per Zip Code

## Results
 The visualizations provided insights into how room types, neighborhoods, and property characteristics influence prices. and here is the link to the dashboard

## Challenges 
The main challenges were handling missing data and ensuring the visualizations were clear and accurate.

## Future Goals
With more time, I would incorporate additional factors like availability and review ratings, and explore predictive models for pricing trends.
